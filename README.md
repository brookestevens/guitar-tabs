# Guitar Tabs Site
A collection of guitar tabs created by me.

## Purpose
This site serves two purposes. First, I wanted to use EJS to create my own static site. This project uses yaml files to add content which is injected into EJS page templates. During the build, the templates are converted into static html pages. Second, this project is a place for me to add tabs for songs that I try to learn on guitar.

## Development
`npm run dev`

Add a new page template.
`npm run new`

## Build
`npm run build`
